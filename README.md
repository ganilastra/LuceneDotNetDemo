# LuceneDotNetDemo
This is a simple Lucene Dot Net demo project

BE SURE TO CREATE A C:\Lucene\Index FOLDER on your machine.

This allows you to search through a Songs (with TITLE, ARTIST, LYRICS, RELEASED DATE fields) using LUCENE.NET

It has two projects 
(1) SearchSongLucene - which is a very simple WINFORMS with very simple UI
(2) SongsSearchBL - contains simple logic that writes indexes, and search them.

Click the Index Data to start writing SONGS DATA (which is hard coded for now) to the LUCENE folder
C:\Lucene\Index
